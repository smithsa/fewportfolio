        <p>For this project, I wanted to create a business card for an eye doctor; while utilizing a new design technique. The project was completed in a week time frame. Sketches were done by hand, and the final logo was created in Adobe Illustrator using the pen tool. The mockup was created in Adobe Photoshop. </p>
