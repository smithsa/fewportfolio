        <p>This poster was a personal project. The goal was to take a royalty-free photo and incorporate it with fun text. The goal was to show the text as part of the image instead of being placed. The text was created in Adobe Illustrator, the photo was enhanced, and the text was incorporated in Adobe Photoshop. I wanted to achieve an 80â€™s beach party vibe.</p>
